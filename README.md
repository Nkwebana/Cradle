# cradle
Repository to store (mostly source code) files for the Cradle project
GitHub will be used for version control
After a certain version of Cradle is developed, tested and signed off, we will commit it to the master branch
As we develop new functionality, we will create new smaller branches that will be tested and committed to the master branch
